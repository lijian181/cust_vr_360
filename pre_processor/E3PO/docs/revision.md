# E3PO v2.0.1
In response to recent contestantsâ€™ feedback, we have made updates to the [E3PO system code.](https://github.com/bytedance/E3PO) The main updates include:
- We have reconstructed the overall code logic, to make it more clear and understandable.
- We have differentiated the capabilities between E3PO and users, such that contestants are easier to implement their algorithms.
- We have modified the [tutorial documentation](https://github.com/bytedance/E3PO/blob/main/docs/Tutorial.md), and we strongly recommend contestants read this document first for subsequent development.

Additionally, it should be noted that the [due date of this GC](https://2024.acmmmsys.org/gc/360-vod/) has been adjusted. 

For the updated E3PO repo, if you have any further questions, please let us know through the [discussion group](https://github.com/bytedance/E3PO/blob/main/mmsys24gc/mmsys24gc_group.jpeg) or via email.
